    Standard Terms of Service
    1. Introduction
    These Terms of Service ("Terms"), including our Privacy Policy, govern your access to and use of our website: http://www.smartystreets.com (herein referred to as the "Site"), it's content, or API Software service(s) (collectively the
    "Service(s)") provided by SmartyStreets, LLC, (herein the "Company", "we", "our" or "us"). By accessing and using the Services, visitors, users, potential client or actual client (herein "Client", "you", "your", or "user") agree these Terms
    govern your access to the Site and license to use the Services provided therein. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity ("Organization"), you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you
    represent and warrant that you have authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In such cases, "you" and "your" refers to you and that Organization. In the event of any conflict between the Terms and any separate executed agreement with
    the Company, the Terms and conditions of the separate agreement will prevail and govern.

    2. Definitions
    2.1 "Affiliate" means a legal entity controlling, controlled by, or under common Control with the Client which shall be considered equally, jointly and severally liable to all legal obligations of this Agreement. "Control" means possessing a 50%
    or greater interest in an entity or the right to direct the management of the entity. For purposes of subscription to Services, an Affiliate is each individual Client who must establish an account before using our Services.

    2.2 "Aggregate Data" refers to numerical or non-numerical information that is (1) collected from multiple sources and/or on multiple measures, variables, or individuals and (2) compiled into data summaries or summary reports, typically for the
    purposes of reporting or statistical analysis—i.e., examining trends, making comparisons, or revealing information and insights that would not be observable when data elements are viewed in isolation. Company may aggregate submitted address
    information so that it no longer reflects or references an identifiable natural person for the purpose of creating statistical summaries, for benchmarking, and for use in research and development to create, refine, and improve Company products
    and services.

    2.3 "Client" is any person, entity, visitor, user, subscriber, pre-existing client or potential client accessing and using our Services. (It includes any user, subscribers or affiliate with donated or free evaluation accounts).

    2.4 "Client Data" means the information, and/or input data, including an address or any other Personal Data contained therein, in any form or media, that is (i) submitted or entered into the Company's cloud based system or Site by Client or on
    behalf of Client or its end users; (ii) accessed or used by Company in providing any Services to Client; or (iii) data and content collected, compiled, inferred, stored, cached, or derived directly or indirectly from any of the data and content
    described in subclauses (i) and (ii) herein.

    2.5 "Content" or "Output Data" means deliverables, postal data, authoritative address or geo-location information and databases included and embedded in Company's proprietary software, or database(s) used to process, produce, and deliver Services
    owned, controlled, or licensed by Company or its respective Licensor.

    2.6 "Data Privacy Laws" mean collectively any applicable data protection, privacy or similar laws applicable to the processing of personal data in the jurisdiction selected herein and/or applicable to the Personal Data processed as part of the
    Services, including, without limitation, the United States Data Privacy Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, ("HIPAA"), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended, the adoption of the California Consumer
    Privacy Act ("CCPA") and adherence to the general principles of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, (EU) 2016/679.

    2.7 "Documentation" means written explanations of the intended functionality of the Services and the Site and other written material generally intended to guide the user of the Services in the installation, modification, execution, comprehension,
    or other use of the Site or other necessary software, including, but without limitation, user guides, training materials, worksheets, workbooks, implementation and reference materials, and other documentation, whether in printed or electronic
    form.

    2.8 "Enhanced Data Privacy" also referred to as "Incognito mode" is an optional feature that Enterprise Clients may elect to purchase which prevents Client Data and or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from ever being logged at the point
    of submission to Company's APIs. Client Data submissions are accessed only momentarily in Random Access Memory (RAM), just long enough to process and deliver results back to Client. Upon completion of such process, any residual Client Data in RAM
    is dumped or "garbage collected" and written over by subsequent transactions. Such processing methods render data deletion, destruction, correction, blocking, or exportation back to Client not feasible due to the nature of the transitory process.

    2.9 "Intellectual Property Rights" means all right, title, and interest in and to, as applicable, any copyright, software, design, logo, trademark, service mark, patent, invention, trade secret, domain name, Confidential Information, know-how,
    technology, business name, trade name, trade dress, technical solutions, associated right to sue (past, present, and future), any other intellectual property rights whether existing at common law, applied for, registered or unregistered and all
    extensions, renewals, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisionals, reissues, re-examinations, and revivals therefor and existing anywhere in the world.

    2.10 "Licensor(s)" means entities and organizations that supply Company updated resources and licenses to access authoritative and proprietary databases.

    2.11 "Lookup(s)" means a submission of Client Data including but not limited to addresses, geocodes, postal codes, etc. by a Client or a Permitted User to be processed by Company's products or Service. Every individual data submission is counted
    as a single lookup. Client is responsible and agrees to pay for any Lookups performed on its account, even if unintended or accidental. (For example, if Client creates an automated API call to Company's International Street API, and happens to
    have an unintended loop in its code causing "runaway" calls to be made to the API, Client will still be responsible to pay for each Lookup attempted).

    2.12 "Parties" means Client and Company and "Party" means either of them individually.

    2.13 "Payment Terms" are the conditions under which the Company will complete the sale to the Client. Details of the payment depend upon the Service plan that is purchased and are specified and set forth in the subscription process.

    passwords. Affiliates of Clients are not Permitted Users without establishing their own Client accounts or without the expressed consent of the Company.

    2.15 "Personal Data" or "Personally Identifiable Information" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by
    reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
    person), or as that term (or similar variants) may otherwise be defined in applicable data protection, privacy, breach notification, or data security laws or regulations, including Protected Health Information ("PHI") under Health Insurance

    provided on a subscription basis and accessible to Client via the Internet as described in the Service Order Form, including without limitation all third-party licensed technology, software, or systems and the Company's Documentation.

    2.17 "Services" means any and all electronic and programmed computer instructions used to provide the services, including without limitation, professional services, Support Services, and access to and data processing from the Platform or
    Client-Hosted Software provided by Company to Client, as described in the Service Order Form. In connection with the Services, Company commits to the provisions of the Service Level Agreement, attached as Schedule A.

    2.18 "Support Services" means any maintenance or support provided by the Company in respect of its Services, Platform or Client-Hosted Software.

    2.19 "Update" means a modification, correction or addition to the Platform or Client-Hosted Software or Documentation, including updates and enhancements that the Company makes generally available to its clients as part of Support Services
    without additional charge. The definition of "Update" excludes Upgrades.

    Terms from time to time without prior notice to you. Our Services provide an ability for you to submit and compare your address, input data or "Client Data" with our Company's authoritative database and to receive updated Output Data results or
    "Content" via our API Services. Client Data you submit must be adequate and relevant but not excessive to location validation and verification purposes. The Site, its Content, and software are not available or licensed to competitors of the

    4. Use of International API Product
    Each and every address Lookup request that you submit to our International API is counted as one used or purchased Lookup. We require that you keep a valid credit card listed on your account. You are responsible for any Lookups performed on your
    account, even if unintended or accidental. For example, if you create an automated API call and you happen to have an unintended loop in your code which causes "runaway" calls to be made to our International API Services, you will still be
    responsible for each international Lookup attempted. This could result in significant charges to your credit card. Please ensure that your code is correct prior to automating any calls to our International API. Similar to our US Street API
    service, you will be able to choose a subscription plan that will accommodate your non-USPS address lookup needs.

    the following per-occurrence fees without exception. A $50 administration fee, a $25 chargeback fee, and a $50 recovery fee. These fees, along with any disputed charges, will result in a negative balance on your account which must be paid fully

    this Agreement by reference and shall be legally binding. If you subscribe to a free plan of 250 US Street API lookups per month, you are allowed to use the Services free of charge for a maximum of one year after which renewal extension,
    suspension or termination may occur at Company's sole discretion.

    28. Limitation of Liability
    The Company shall not be liable to Client for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your access to or use of, or inability to access or use, the Site, Software, or Content, whether based on

    applicable law, the Company's maximum aggregate liability arising from or in connection with this Agreement (including the Services or the subject matter of this Agreement) will be limited to, and shall not exceed, one dollar ($1.00); and in no

    29. No Right of Offset
    Client may not offset any amounts to which it may be entitled under the terms of this Agreement against amounts otherwise payable to the Company under this Agreement. The foregoing will not constitute an election of remedies or otherwise limit
    Client or Company in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it herewith.

    30. Taxes
    Company may charge and Client shall pay all applicable sales, use or value-added taxes ("Sales Taxes") that Company is legally obligated to charge for the Services, unless Client provides Company with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate
    (or other documentation as required by the exemption, including proof of self-assessment) authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

    31. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction
    These Terms and any action related thereto (including taxation issues) will be governed by the laws of the State of Utah without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the
    Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Utah. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action arising under these Terms or related thereto will be the state and federal courts located in Utah County, State of Utah, and each
    of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. In any action to enforce this clause or this Agreement, the prevailing Party will be entitled to costs and reasonable attorneys' fees.

    32. Dispute Resolution/Arbitration
    Any disputes and claims relating to use of the Service or the application of these Terms shall be resolved as follows:

    Exclusive Dispute Resolution Mechanism. The Parties shall resolve any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof (each, a "Dispute"), under the provisions of this
    clause. The procedures set forth in this shall be the exclusive mechanism for resolving any Dispute that may arise from time to time and are the expressed conditions precedent to arbitration or litigation of the Dispute.
    Negotiations. A Party shall send written notice to the other Party of any Dispute. The Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute set forth in the notice by negotiation and consultation between themselves, including not
    fewer than three (3) negotiation sessions attended by a Director level or higher for both Client and Company. For purposes of clarification, the Party sending a notice of an Escalation to Director level or higher shall send such notices in
    compliance with the Notice section herein.
    Escalation. If the Parties cannot resolve any Dispute under this clause within thirty (30) days after a written notice, either Party may seek resolution by initiating arbitration in Utah County, Utah administered by Judicial Arbitration and
    Mediation Service (JAMS). BINDING ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL. Judgment rendered shall be binding and any award entered by JAMS arbitrator may be pursued and enforced by any court having legal jurisdiction. The
    non-prevailing Party shall bear all costs, expenses, and reasonable attorneys' fees for arbitration.
    Legally Binding. In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator has no authority to make errors of law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator does so. Otherwise, the arbitrator's decision is final and binding on all parties and may be
    enforced in any federal or state court that has jurisdiction. Neither you nor the Company shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative
    member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity. Accordingly, you agree that the JAMS Class Action Procedures do not apply to our arbitration.
